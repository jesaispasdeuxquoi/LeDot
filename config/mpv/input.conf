# mpv keybindings
#
# Location of user-defined bindings: ~/.config/mpv/input.conf
#
# Lines starting with # are comments. Use SHARP to assign the # key.
# Copy this file and uncomment and edit the bindings you want to change.
#
# List of commands and further details: DOCS/man/input.rst
# List of special keys: --input-keylist
# Keybindings testing mode: mpv --input-test --force-window --idle
#
# Use 'ignore' to unbind a key fully (e.g. 'ctrl+a ignore').
#
# Strings need to be quoted and escaped:
#   KEY show-text "This is a single backslash: \\ and a quote: \" !"
#
# You can use modifier-key combinations like Shift+Left or Ctrl+Alt+x with
# the modifiers Shift, Ctrl, Alt and Meta (may not work on the terminal).
#
# The default keybindings are hardcoded into the mpv binary.
# You can disable them completely with: --no-input-default-bindings

# Developer note:
# On compilation, this file is baked into the mpv binary, and all lines are
# uncommented (unless '#' is followed by a space) - thus this file defines the
# default key bindings.

# If this is enabled, treat all the following bindings as default.
#default-bindings start

MBTN_LEFT     ignore              # don't do anything
MBTN_LEFT_DBL ignore    # toggle fullscreen on/off
MBTN_RIGHT    ignore         # toggle pause on/off

# Mouse wheels, touchpad or other input devices that have axes
# if the input devices supports precise scrolling it will also scale the
# numeric value accordingly
WHEEL_UP      add volume 5
WHEEL_DOWN    add volume -5 
#WHEEL_LEFT    add volume -2
#WHEEL_RIGHT   add volume 2

## Seek units are in seconds, but note that these are limited by keyframes
RIGHT seek  5
LEFT  seek -5
UP    seek  125
DOWN  seek -125
# Do smaller, always exact (non-keyframe-limited), seeks with shift.
# Don't show them on the OSD (no-osd).
#Shift+RIGHT no-osd seek  1 exact
#Shift+LEFT  no-osd seek -1 exact
#Shift+UP    no-osd seek  5 exact
#Shift+DOWN  no-osd seek -5 exact
# Skip to previous/next subtitle (subject to some restrictions; see manpage)
#Ctrl+LEFT   no-osd sub-seek -1
#Ctrl+RIGHT  no-osd sub-seek  1
# Adjust timing to previous/next subtitle
#Ctrl+Shift+LEFT sub-step -1
#Ctrl+Shift+RIGHT sub-step 1
